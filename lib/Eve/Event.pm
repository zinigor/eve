                                  ->trigger();

handlers bound to them.

    return;
}

=head1 METHODS

=head2 B<trigger()>

The C<trigger()> method is used to start processing the event by all
handlers that are bound to it and its ancestors.

sub trigger {
    my $self = shift;

    my $handler_list = $self->_event_map->get_handler_list(event => $self);
    for my $handler (@{$handler_list}) {
        $handler->handle(event => $self);
    }

    return;
}
